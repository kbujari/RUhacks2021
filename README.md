Intro Edu is a site built with HTML5/CSS3, and basic Javascript, looking to provide a modern, streamlined UI, for users interested in learning new skills, but don't know where to start.

&nbsp;

It uses a fast, scalable design that uses pre-existing learning resources to bring content across the web to a single page to use as a launchpad.

&nbsp;

## Why build Intro Edu?

Many people decide they want to learn a new skill, but end up not even starting due to the intimidation of the the challenge ahead of them and not knowing where to even begin. Intro Edu aims to remove the "fear of the unknown" by giving users useful starting points to begin learning. By giving people a clear base to start from, the hope is that it becomes easier to stick to their goals.
